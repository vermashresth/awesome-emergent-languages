# Paper Collection and summary on Emergent Languages through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning 

Emergent Languages is a very interesting research area to study how languages emerge artificially, what properties they showcase and whether the functional nature of language and communication can be used to improve upon
otherwise supervised learning setting for natural language tasks. This area has strong connections with Computational Linguisics, Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science and Behaviourial Theory.


I have tried to include as many papers as possible which study emergent languagees through deep learning (language as in discrete messeages, and not mere continious communication). 
Most of these works explore emergent languages in referential game setting.
